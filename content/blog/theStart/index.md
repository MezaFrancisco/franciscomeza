## 👋 Welcome! Let’s Talk About DevOps That Actually Works

Hey there — I’m **Francisco Meza**, and welcome to my corner of the internet.

After spending over a decade deep in the trenches of **DevOps and Platform Engineering**, I figured it was time to start documenting some of the lessons, wins, and (plenty of) learning moments along the way.

Think of this blog as a **digital notepad** — a place where I share real-world insights from scaling infrastructure, debugging mysterious alerts at 2 a.m., or untangling legacy CI pipelines that were duct-taped together back in 2016.

## 🧰 What You Can Expect Here

This won’t be a place for buzzwords or theory-only content. I want to talk about the **real stuff**:

- Why our monitoring bill dropped by $750K after switching to **VictoriaMetrics**
- How I helped migrate a legacy platform to **Kubernetes** in under 30 days
- What actually breaks during a **CI/CD migration** — and how to fix it
- The DevOps tools I love (and the ones I’d rather never see again)

Whether you’re a solo engineer figuring out **Terraform** for the first time, or someone leading platform efforts at scale, I hope you find something helpful here — or at the very least, relatable.

## 🔄 DevOps Is More Than Tools

Yes, I work with Terraform, Kubernetes, ArgoCD, and all the shiny stuff — but the real challenge in DevOps isn’t just infrastructure.

It’s about:

- Knowing when to **refactor vs. rebuild**
- Getting buy-in from teams that don’t care about “IaC”
- Teaching others without gatekeeping
- Balancing **stability with speed**

That’s what I want to write about. Not just *how* things work, but **how to make them work for you**.

## 🚀 Up Next

In the next post, I’ll break down one of the most impactful changes I’ve made recently: **using Karpenter for auto-scaling Kubernetes workloads** — and what it saved us in real terms.

*Spoiler: It wasn’t just money.*

Until then — thanks for stopping by. If you’re into cloud-native tech, DevOps, or just want to geek out about monitoring stacks, stick around. More to come soon.

— **Francisco**
