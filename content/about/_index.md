# About Me

Hi, I’m **Francisco Meza** — a **Staff DevOps Engineer** with over a decade of experience designing, scaling, and securing cloud infrastructure.  

I specialize in:  

- **Cloud & Kubernetes Architecture** – AWS, EKS, ECS, Terraform, Ansible  
- **DevOps & Automation** – CI/CD pipelines, GitOps with ArgoCD, monitoring systems  
- **Security & Compliance** – PCI, SOC2 automation, vulnerability management  
- **Performance & Cost Optimization** – Cloud cost reduction, auto-scaling, efficient workloads  

Beyond technology, I value **collaboration, mentoring, and building resilient systems** that support business growth. My work has consistently helped companies save costs, improve reliability, and deliver at scale.  

When I’m not automating infrastructure, I enjoy exploring new technologies, teaching others, and sharing knowledge in the DevOps and cloud community.
